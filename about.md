## Want to know more?

(To the tune of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air)

Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right back
I'll tell you how I became a dev for the full stack

In east Alabama born and raised
On the Compaq was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' chattin’ all cool
Dialed up to AOL, logged in after school

Then some HTML when I was up really late
Started showing gifs that would animate
I made one little page and my mom’s voice raised
She said 'You better use those tabs and stop with the spaces'
