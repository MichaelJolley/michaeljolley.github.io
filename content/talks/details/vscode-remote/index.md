> Think inside the box. Developing inside a container to avoid conflicts, improve security and speed up on-boarding. 

As developers, our most famous response, "it works on my machine," doesn't cut it anymore. We need a way to develop each project in environments that are as identical to production as possible. In this presentation, we learn how to use Visual Studio Code Remote Development to standardize the development environments for each project, remove the need to install third party software like Python or Node, and ensure that when it runs on "my" machine, it runs in production.
