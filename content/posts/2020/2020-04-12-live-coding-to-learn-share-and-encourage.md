"Start Streaming." Two simple words. They seemed so innocent. How could I know that a small button with those words would bring such a large change to my life?

Who in the world would want to watch someone write code? Good question. But nearly two years ago I found myself watching [Jeffrey Fritz](https://jeffreyfritz.com/) wearing a pirate hat, playing sound bytes from "Dude, Where's My Car," and yes, writing C# on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/csharpfritz). The community he had built was welcoming and supportive and his approach of pair-programming with viewers while injecting humor really resonated with me.

At the time, I had been developing with C# for nearly 20 years and had been leading a team of developers for 10 of those, but had never taken the time to attend a meet-up or conference. This was my first step into a developer community outside of my workplace and I was hooked.

I quickly became active in several technology Twitch streams and was sold on this medium for teaching and supporting developers. While I had supported and taught teams within my organization, I saw live-coding as a platform to positively impact even more people.

So finally, one afternoon in February, I pressed that small button with those now infamous words; "Start Streaming."

## Lights! Camera! A-ha!

I'm thankful that Twitch doesn't retain streams indefinitely. Those first streams were rough; hours of talking to myself or a handful of silent viewers. Fortunately, many of the friends I had made in other streams joined me and were fully supportive.

I spent those first few months doing what I knew: C# & Angular. I was working on client projects that I thought people would find interesting. I would stream for three to five hours and then watch the replay to see what I could do better.

Then it dawned on me; I was starting each stream from a place of knowledge that viewers might not have. I had spent 20 years of writing C# so there were things that I instinctively knew about the language, the tooling, or available libraries. And while that knowledge helped me build solutions for my clients, it could alienate people new to software development; as I was expecting viewers to come in with that same (or a close) level of understanding.

## Let's Learn Together

During this time I was watching [Brian Clark](https://twitch.tv/clarkio) (aka Clarkio). He has a blurb that he goes through whenever someone follows his channel, but it always ends with "sit back, relax and let's learn together." I've heard it said so often that it's permanently imprinted in my brain; so it's no surprise that it was the first thing I thought of when thinking of how to solve my problem.

Based on that simple phrase, I decided to completely change the goal of my streams. I would no longer work on client projects and rarely use C# or Angular. Instead, I would spend each session doing something I didn't know how to do so we could literally "learn together."

This shift made a tremendous difference; we were learning together. Viewers would teach me and vice-versa. Suddenly a new viewer could contribute and be apart of the project on their first visit and as an added bonus, I was learning new technologies.

## Made For This

Within weeks, messages starting coming in from viewers enjoying the change.
