### Today's Candle To Code By

## Things we learned

- [Particle](https://www.particle.io) has several devices that can use cellular, Wi-Fi & mesh
- Using the [Partical Argon](https://store.particle.io/products/argon-kit) as the "mother" for child [Particle Xenon](https://store.particle.io/products/xenon-kit) boards allows them to communicate via a mesh network and then only allow 'mother' access to the network.
- [Onion](https://onion.io/) boards are another option for us but, like the Raspberry Pi, may be a bit overkill
- [MX Chip](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/) is another option with many sensors built-in.  In the use case of our planter box, it's definitely more than we need.


## Things to Review & Notes

- New emotes are still pending.
- Heroine interviews on Sunday afternoons


## Goals

- [x] Discuss IoT hardware options (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, MX Chip & Particle products)
- [x] Determine the best hardware for our plant watering system


## Next Steps

- Order hardware for our plant watering system
- Build out the planter boxes (like with wood & stuff)
