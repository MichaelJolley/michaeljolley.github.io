## Things we learned

- [Major Thorn](https://www.orban.com/meter) shared [Orban Loudness Meter](https://www.orban.com/meter) with us to control audio levels for the stream
- [VirtualAssistant](https://github.com/chatbots) shared a VOD [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlILRwOPAps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlILRwOPAps) of his work in IoT
- [BrandonSatrom](https://github.com/brandonsatrom) shared [JsonParserGeneratorRK](https://github.com/rickkas7/JsonParserGeneratorRK) to aid in generating/parsing JSON in C++

## Things to Review & Notes

- 

## Goals

- [x] Push a button on the Xenon and make the LED on the Argon blink

## Next Steps

- Get the correct readings from our sensor on the Xenon sending to the Argon
