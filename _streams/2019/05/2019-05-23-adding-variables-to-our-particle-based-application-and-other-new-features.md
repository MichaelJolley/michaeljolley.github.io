## Things we learned

- [RamblingGeekUk](https://github.com/ramblinggeekuk) looked in the [Particle documentation](https://community.particle.io/t/plans-for-emulator/19277) and found there are currently no emulators for their devices
- [Soil Moisture Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4026?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvIrJ_5Gp4gIVkbXACh2DNwpuEAQYASABEgIxuvD_BwE)s that were ordered at [BrandonSatrom](https://github.com/bsatrom)'s suggestion
- [LittleDan45](https://twitch.tv/LittleDan45) asked do we need to check for electrical conductivity? We may want to look in to that

## Things to Review & Notes

- Moisture sensors are being delivered today and should be ready for Sunday's stream
- Heroines of JavaScript series picks back up on June 2nd with the girls interviewing [Natalia Tepluhina](https://twitter.com/N_Tepluhina)
- IO, our animatronic puppet, should be delivered next week.

## Goals

- [ ] Save start/end hours on our Argon using EEPROM
- [ ] Send variables to Particle for logging

## Next Steps
