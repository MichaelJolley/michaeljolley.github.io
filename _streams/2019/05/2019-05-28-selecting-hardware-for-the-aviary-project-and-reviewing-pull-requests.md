## Things we learned

- [IAmNotMyself](https://github.com/notmyself) showed us how to add a remote to your forked branch via `git remote add upstream git-clone-url`
- [IAmNotMyself](https://github.com/notmyself) turned us on to [hub](https://hub.github.com). An extension to CLI git
- [dot_commie](https://www.twitch.tv/dot_commie) was a HUGE help in identifying hardware for our Aviary project


## Things to Review & Notes

- [Natalia Tepluhina](https://twitter.com/N_Tepluhina) will be joining us next Sunday, June 2nd, as we
continue our [Heroines of Javascript](https://www.twitch.tv/themichaeljolley/events) series
- IO is in the house


## Goals

- [x] Review pull requests on the VS Code Twitch Themer extension
- [x] Identify the solenoid valve to use in our [Aviary](https://github.com/MichaelJolley/aviary) project
