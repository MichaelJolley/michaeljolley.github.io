## Things to Review & Notes

- Next Sunday we'll have [Sara Vieira](https://www.twitch.tv/events/0YK5JEx4SLa9roW1aK6jBA) on with
Lauryn & Layla as part of our [Heroines of JavaScript](https://www.twitch.tv/themichaeljolley/dashboard/events/IUXJeFyqRReQAI5BLaUivQ) series
- All but one piece of hardware is in for our [Aviary](https://github.com/michaeljolley/aviary) project.
- Tuesday will be a long stream.  We'll start on time at 2pm ET / 11am PT / 6pm UTC but will run longer
than two hours as we fill in for [roberttables](https://twitch.tv/roberttables).  In his honor, we'll probably
work on Aviary hardware and get everything connected and soldered.

## Goals

- [x] Add dynamic chat commands to IO that allow sound clips to be played
- [ ] Add flag to turn on/off ability for sound clips
