I"î<p>I am still extremely new to streaming my coding sessions but I‚Äôve been hooked watching streams like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/csharpfritz">Fritz &amp; Friends</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/clarkio">Clarkio</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/roberttables">Robert Tables</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/talk2megooseman">Talk2meGooseman</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/devchatter">DevChatter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/noopkat">NoopKat</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are so many more good streams doing live-coding with all types of technology.  So I‚Äôve started working a lot more at trying to get my setup just right so I could live code some personal projects and hopefully help others learn new technologies.</p>

<p>It is really helpful as I‚Äôm getting started to see the blog posts and content generated by these streamers with their hardware &amp; software setups so I was motivated to provide something similar in the hopes that someone else can kick off a great stream and advance the community.</p>

<p>So without further delay:</p>

<h2>Audio/Video Setup</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm still learning a lot about lighting and audio.  There is a lot of experimentation going on in these areas right now so a lot of what‚Äôs below is subject to change.</p>

<p>Above my monitors I have two <a href="https://amzn.to/2Te5LOd">Elgato Key Light</a> panels.  Both are set to provide more yellow light than blue to offset the blue light coming from my 3 24‚Äù monitors.</p>

<p>Behind me is a <a href="https://amzn.to/2BPi7m2">Fovitec StudioPRO</a> 5‚Äô x 6.5‚Äô blue/green screen held up with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2U52qy4">Fovitec clip stand</a>.</p>

<p>My lighting setup is not perfect and I‚Äôm still tweaking the levels to improve.  I feel like I need another type of light behind me to better illuminate the green screen to improve the chroma-key.  I‚Äôve actually been debating moving one of the key lights to the center front and moving the other behind me to illuminate the green screen.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been using the <a href="https://amzn.to/2ErynLP">Logitech C922x Webcam</a> for my primary video.  It seems to do well and I‚Äôm currently using Xsplit Vcam software to handle the background removal.  I purchased the webcam based on feedback from other streamers and haven‚Äôt been disappointed with it.</p>

<p>For the audio I‚Äôm using an <a href="https://amzn.to/2E6Z9HS">Audio-Technica AT2020</a> condenser microphone with a pop filter. That runs into a <a href="https://amzn.to/2U3ACKv">Focusrite Scarlett Solo</a> USB audio interface and into the PC from there.  I‚Äôve been really happy with the mic.  Our company uses MS Teams heavily with its call/video recording and I use this mic exclusively now rather than a headset mic.</p>

<h2>Other Hardware</h2>

<p>My streams have really been focused on IoT development and I‚Äôve found it difficult to display what‚Äôs going on with my <a href="https://amzn.to/2EhMOkr">Raspberry Pi</a>‚Äôs video onto the stream.  So far I‚Äôve been limited to only displaying an SSH window to the Pi.  So a new addition to the family is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XhXwQl">Elgato HD60 Pro</a> game capture card.  This receives an HDMI input and shows in OBS as a video source that I can share on the stream.  This will get its first use in a few days on the stream.</p>

<p>Speaking of working on IoT devices, I‚Äôve often had the problem of connecting keyboards &amp; mice to them and then having to rewire everything as I switched devices or put it away.  Then <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> turned me on to the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Npx0jt">iPazzPort Wireless Mini Handheld Keyboard/Touchpad</a>.</p>

<p>This is a mini-keyboard with a built in touch pad that is a <em>MUST HAVE</em> if you work with devices like the Rapsberry Pi at all.  It‚Äôs only $14 so it was a no-brainer purchase.</p>

<p>The final piece of hardware that I‚Äôm constantly finding uses for (even when not streaming) is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Er27bE">Elgato Stream Deck</a>.  This little device is a wonder and with the new SDK released by Elgato I have a feeling an ecosystem of extensions/add-ons are about to spring up around this guy.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm not using a ton of software, but here‚Äôs the rundown:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> for scenes and actual recording/streaming.  Also do some audio filtering here, though that is very much still a work in progress.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/downloads">Elgato Game Capture for Windows</a> to capture the input from the HD60 Pro.</li>
  <li>On my stream, you‚Äôll see alerts &amp; widgets provided by <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">StreamLabs</a>.  They make it easy to add customized alerts to your stream.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>That‚Äôs the current run-down.  I hope to expound more on my findings as I work to improve the audio/video production of the stream so future streamers can get there faster.  In all, I‚Äôve really enjoyed live-coding on stream.  More than anything I‚Äôve really gotten a lot from the relationships formed and am constantly amazed at the friendliness &amp; helpfulness of all those involved.</p>

<p>Got any suggestions to improve my stream or other hardware/audio/video ideas?  Leave me a comment or find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/michaeljolley">@michaeljolley</a> or Twitch <a href="https://twitch.tv/themichaeljolley">themichaeljolley</a>.</p>
