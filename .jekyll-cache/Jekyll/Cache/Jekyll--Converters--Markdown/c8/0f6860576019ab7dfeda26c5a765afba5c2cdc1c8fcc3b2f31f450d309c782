I"}<p>So. I like this tutorial, however, there is no longer an lxsession directory in the user home directory. The only directories in .config are chromium, lxpanel, and lxterminal.</p>

<p>The is an lxsession directory in /etc/xdg/. Should I be editing this file? It seems that wouldnâ€™t be true since it appears to be a global setting.</p>

<p>Please advise.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
