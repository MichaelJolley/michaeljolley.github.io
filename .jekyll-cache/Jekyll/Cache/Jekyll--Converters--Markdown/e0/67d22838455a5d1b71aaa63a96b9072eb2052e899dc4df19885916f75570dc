I"ˆ<h3>Want to know more?</h3>

<p>(To the tune of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air)</p>

<p>Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And Iâ€™d like to take a minute
Just sit right back
Iâ€™ll tell you how I became a dev for the full stack</p>

<p>In east Alabama born and raised
On the Compaq was where I spent most of my days
Chillinâ€™ out maxinâ€™ chattinâ€™ all cool
Dialed up to AOL, logged in after school</p>

<p>Then some HTML when I was up really late
Started showing gifs that would animate
I made one little page and my momâ€™s voice raised
She said â€˜You better use those tabs and stop with the spacesâ€™</p>
