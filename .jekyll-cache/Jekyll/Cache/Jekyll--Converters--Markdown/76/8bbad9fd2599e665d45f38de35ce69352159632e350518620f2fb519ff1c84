<p>It seems that lately I’ve been creating a new public repo every other day. A few 
have even received pull requests from other contributors. As that list of contributors 
began to grow I realized there were a few things that I, and probably other repository 
maintainers, want to provide.  So, as always, when I learn something new, I write a 
blog post.</p>

<p>My goal is to explain the benefits of acknowledging contributors and providing them 
with contributing and code of conduct guidelines.</p>

<h2>Contributing Guidelines</h2>

<p>For the most part, contributors have seen my repositories on our <a href="https://twitch.tv/themichaeljolley">Twitch</a> stream 
and wanted to help.  The benefit to the stream is that viewers can see the process we use 
to submit pull requests, our branching strategies, etc. However, for those that want to 
join in on the fun later, it’s likely that their pull requests will be directed to the 
wrong branch or perhaps for an issue that is already in progress by another contributor.</p>

<p>To help, I went on a search for example <code class="highlighter-rouge">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> files across GitHub.  There 
were several great examples. A few are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426">PurpleBooth</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Puppet</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Factory Bot Rails</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I modified thoughtbot’s Factory Bot Rails version to meet my needs and added it to all my 
active public repositories.  You can see an example in our 
<a href="https://github.com/MichaelJolley/aviary/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Aviary</a> repo.</p>

<p>At a minimum, your CONTRIBUTING.md should include details about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What type of contributions are permitted? (documentation/code/ideas/tests/examples/etc.)</li>
  <li>Instructions for adding issues</li>
  <li>Instructions for forking &amp; submitting pull requests</li>
</ul>

<p>This basic information gives potential contributors a little more confidence about 
submitting that pull request by alleviating the fear they’ll be blasted for using the 
wrong base branch.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>I’ll admit I’m a little knew to this one. I’m not sure I’ve ever read a repositories Code of 
Conduct before this week. It’s easy to overlook when you expect the best from people and/or 
haven’t experienced the effects of poor conduct when participating in public repo communities. 
But the fact that I’ve never personally experienced something doesn’t mean I should overlook 
that bad behavior in the development community does exist. In fact, regardless of 
my personal experiences, I want everyone to feel included and safe to share ideas and collaborate.</p>

<p>Having a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in your public repository lets potential contributors know in 
advance how they can expect to be treated by the community and maintainers. 
<a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a> is a great resource for a Code 
of Conduct for your repository.</p>

<h2>Acknowledging Contributions</h2>

<p>I love new contributors! It makes my day when I get a notification that someone created an 
issue, submitted a pull request or even just forked the repository. There are several ways to 
show love for your contributors but one I’ve recently implemented (and love) is the 
<a href="https://allcontributors.org/">All Contributors</a> specification.</p>

<p>When someone contributes I simply comment on an issue or pull request and the 
All Contributors bot creates a pull request that gives that person an acknowledgement 
on our README.md.</p>

<p>An example from our VS Code extension is:</p>

<p>Not all contributions are code.  Using All Contributors, I can recognize contributors for everything from ideas, questions, documentation, tests, examples and more.  A full listing of options is available on their <a href="https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key">emoji key</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a fun way to give credit where it’s due and encourage others to participate.</p>

<p>That’s my TED Talk for today.  Do you have ideas on how to help new contributors join in? Let me hear them!</p>
